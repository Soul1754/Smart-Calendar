## Getting Started

If you're new to the project, we recommend starting with the [Project Documentation](./project-documentation.md) to get a high-level overview of the system architecture and implementation details.

For developers working on specific parts of the application:

- Backend developers should focus on the [API Documentation](./api-documentation.md)
- Frontend developers should refer to the [Frontend Documentation](./frontend-documentation.md)
- For OAuth setup, refer to the [Google OAuth Setup](./google-oauth-setup.md) guide

## Project Structure

The Smart Calendar application is organized into two main directories:

- `backend/`: Node.js/Express backend with MongoDB integration
- `frontend/`: React-based frontend application

Each directory contains its own package.json file with the necessary dependencies and scripts.

## Development Workflow

1. Clone the repository
2. Set up environment variables (see .env.example files in both frontend and backend)
3. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend
4. Start the development servers
5. Refer to the documentation for implementation details

## Contributing

When contributing to the project, please ensure that you update the relevant documentation to reflect any changes made to the codebase.
