# âœ… Calendar Week Grid Fix - Final Update

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Horizontal Week Grid (Not Vertical List)** âœ…

The calendar now properly displays days as **horizontal columns** in week view:

```
Sun 5  â”‚  Mon 6  â”‚  Tue 7  â”‚  Wed 8  â”‚  Thu 9  â”‚  Fri 10  â”‚  Sat 11
â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¼â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¼â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¼â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¼â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¼â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¼â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
12 AM  â”‚         â”‚         â”‚         â”‚         â”‚          â”‚
 1 AM  â”‚         â”‚         â”‚         â”‚         â”‚          â”‚
 2 AM  â”‚         â”‚  [Event]â”‚         â”‚         â”‚          â”‚
 ...   â”‚         â”‚         â”‚         â”‚         â”‚          â”‚
```

**Changes made:**

- Added explicit `views={["day", "week"]}` prop to Calendar component
- Imported `react-big-calendar/lib/css/react-big-calendar.css`
- Updated day format to show "Sun 5", "Mon 6", etc.

### 2. **Removed Month View** âœ…

Only Day and Week views are now available:

- Removed "Month" button from view toggle
- Updated TypeScript types: `view: "week" | "day"`
- Removed month navigation logic

### 3. **Added Refresh Button** âœ…

New refresh button in the toolbar to manually refresh calendar events:

```tsx
<Button variant="ghost" size="icon" onClick={() => refetch()} title="Refresh calendar">
  <ArrowPathIcon className="h-5 w-5" />
</Button>
```

**Location:** Between "Today" button and navigation arrows

### 4. **Debug Logging for Events** âœ…

Added console logging to track event fetching:

- Logs raw API response
- Logs formatted events
- Helps identify if events are being fetched but not displayed

## Updated Toolbar Layout

```
[+ Create] [Today] [ðŸ”„] [< >] October 2025          [Day] [Week]
```

Where:

- **+ Create** â†’ Create new meeting
- **Today** â†’ Jump to today's date
- **ðŸ”„** â†’ Refresh calendar events
- **< >** â†’ Navigate previous/next
- **October 2025** â†’ Current month/year
- **Day/Week** â†’ View toggle (Month removed)

## Why Events Might Not Show

If events still don't appear, check:

1. **API Response Format**

   ```javascript
   // Expected format from calendarAPI.getAllEvents()
   {
     events: [
       {
         id: "123",
         summary: "Meeting Title",
         start: { dateTime: "2025-10-10T14:00:00Z" },
         end: { dateTime: "2025-10-10T15:00:00Z" },
         description: "...",
         location: "...",
         attendees: [...]
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Browser Console** - Check for:
   - "No events data:" - API returned nothing
   - "Raw events from API:" - Shows what API returned
   - "Formatted events for calendar:" - Shows what's passed to calendar
   - Network errors

3. **Backend Connection**
   - Ensure backend is running on port 5001
   - Check if user has connected Google/Microsoft calendar
   - Verify OAuth tokens are valid

4. **Date Range**
   - Events might be outside current week view
   - Try creating a test event for current week

## Files Modified

1. **`app/(dashboard)/calendar/page.tsx`**
   - Changed view type to `"week" | "day"`
   - Removed Month view button
   - Added refresh button with ArrowPathIcon
   - Added console logging for debugging
   - Updated navigation logic

2. **`components/calendar/CalendarView.tsx`**
   - Added CSS import: `react-big-calendar/lib/css/react-big-calendar.css`
